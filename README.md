# weatherscraper
Weatherscraper written in Python.

Uses OpenWeather's API to scrape the five day forecast.
Prints out the high and low temperature averages for each day.

This was not intended for any kind of daily use and as such the results only print to the console rather than recording the data to a file or sending the information to email/text etc.
